Coding Challenge #1

Your tasks:
    1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h
    2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console
    3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console
    4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
'brake' multiple times on each of them

Test data:
    § Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
    § Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
*/

console.log("Coding Challenge #1: ");
const Car = function (make, speed) {
  this.make = make;
  this.speed = speed;
};

Car.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed += 10;
  console.log(this.speed);
};

Car.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed -= 5;
  console.log(this.speed);
};

const bmw = new Car("BMW", 120);
const mercedes = new Car("Mercedes", 95);

bmw.accelerate();
bmw.accelerate();
bmw.brake();

mercedes.accelerate();
mercedes.brake();
mercedes.brake();

/*
Coding Challenge #2

Your tasks:
  1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
  2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)
  3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
  4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.

Test data:
  § Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
